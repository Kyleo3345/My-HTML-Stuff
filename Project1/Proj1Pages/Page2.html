<h1>Godzilla's Showa History</h1>
<body>
<h2>After 1954</h2> <img src="../Proj1assets/Proj1images/Showagodzilla.jpg"> <br />
<p>The sequels after the original(1954 Gojira), called the Showa Era. The producers wanted children to see these films so they reduced the horror on the films throughout this era so that everyone can enjoy the movies. </p><br />
<h2>How Godzilla changed in this era</h2> <img src="../Proj1assets/Proj1images/Showabattle.jpg" height="400px" width="700"> <br />
<p>But in this era, Godzilla is the protector of Earth and Humanity from other monsters like Gigan, Ghidorah, and Hedorah. Although the films were good, they were cheesy, and Godzilla do silly things like flying with his atomic breath and doing a drop kick.</p><br />

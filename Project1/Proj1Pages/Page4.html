<h1>Godzilla's Millennium History</h1>
<body>
<h2>Godzilla is back and more menacing</h2> <img src="../Proj1assets/Proj1images/Godzillamillennium.jpg"> <br />
<p>After the failure of the Tristar Godzilla, Toho makes a grand return and Show the world that the true Godzilla is. Toho brought Godzilla back to the big screen with Godzilla 2000: Millennium, wheras his design is more dinosaur like with sword-like spines, like the Heisei era ignored the Showa era, but continued with from the 1954 original, its the same here but it ignores the Showa and Heisei eras, but continued from the original. The films in this era were standalone reboots and for the 50th anniversary, Godzilla: Final wars.</p><br />
<h2>Themes of this era</h2> <img src="../Proj1assets/Proj1images/Gmkgodzilla.jpg"> <br />
<p>While the themes vary, they do have Godzilla as always. Like with GMK:Giant Monsters all out attack, Godzilla represents the nations past from 1954 when Godzilla first attacked. And the Godzilla 2000: Millennium, it represents the new millennium that is coming soon. After Final Wars, Godzilla took a ten year break until he returned in 2014.</p><br />

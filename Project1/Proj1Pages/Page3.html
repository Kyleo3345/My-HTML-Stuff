<h1>Godzilla's Heisei History</h1>
<body>
<h2>Godzilla's Return</h2> <img src="../Proj1assets/Proj1images/Heiseigodzilla.jpg"> <br />
<p>After the Goofy Showa era ended, Godzilla returned to his destructive roots in the Heisei era. In this era Godzilla is a force of nature, neither good, nor evil, but he battles some of his updated allies/enemies like Mothra, and Ghidorah along with some new Kaiju like Biollante, SpaceGodzilla, and his most deadly Kaiju foe, Destroyah(AKA:Destoroyah (its spelled like this FYI)).</p><br />
<h2>What this era is about for Godzilla</h2><img src="../Proj1assets/Proj1images/Godzillavsdestroyah.jpg"> <br />
<p>This era is about going to extremes and uniqueness. While Godzilla vs Ghidorah has a time travel plot, and Godzilla growing stronger and stronger with every film up until Godzilla vs Destroyah when Godzilla is on the verge of dying and taking the whole planet with him. After Godzilla's death, Toho took a break and Hollywood took over to make a Godzilla film, but it wasn't all Godzilla fans were expecting.</p><br />

<p>In the year 1945, during WW2(World War 2), the atomic bombs were made and detonated, one for testing its power, two more were dropped on Japan (Hiroshima and Nakasaki). WW2 ended becasue of those bombs, and the world feared the power of these bombs. Then 9 years later, When the bomb Castle Bravo (the first hydrogen bomb) detonated a Japanese fishing boat called the Lucky Dragon No5 was exposed to its power, that lead to the inspiration of Gojira.</p><br>

<p>Afer Godzilla's decade long break from the big screen, Legendary Pictures made the next gen Godzilla with high-tech motion capture, and new special effects and CGI, Godzilla was more alive and became an American Franchise and also brought new Kaiju in as well as some of Godzilla's old friends such as Mothra, Ghidorah, and Mechagodzilla, along with a rematch between him and Kong that was tied from the 1960s until the present day.</p><br />

<p>After the successful launch of the Monsterverse from 2014, Toho returned with Shin Godzilla, a fresh rebot with no connection to the 1954 original, this Godzilla evolved with different froms until becoming the Godzilla we all know and love. After that Toho decided to go bigger with Godzilla, LITERALLY!! The anime trilogy which features the most powerful Godzilla yet, powerful enough to drive Humanity away from Earth. YIKES!! And after that, there was Godzilla: Singular Point which is an anime series.</p><br />

<p>Godzilla has been around since the first atomic bombs that were detonated, and since then he has become a iconic and worldwide recognizable monster of all time. He represents nature and ourselfs, without him, we wouldn't be who we are now. Who knows what else might come up in the Godzilla fracnchise? Well we will never know. Since 1954, we've entered a new age. Welcome to the Age of Monsters.</p><br />

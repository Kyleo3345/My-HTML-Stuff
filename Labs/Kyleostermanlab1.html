<h1>Kyle's Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Domain name</h2>
<p>The name for the domain that I have found interesting is develop.fun. It could mean that whoever goes to this site will make their own games and publish them or help modify other games as a group. I would like to develop games as well, therefore I will be using this domain in this portfolio.</p>
<h2>Web host</h2>
<p>I would go for the baby package because it is recommended. It will cost $3.50 per month. It will give you unlimited websites for you to make, One-click WordPress installs, Website transfer, unmetered bandwidth, and free SSl certificate and domain included.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello. My name is Kyle Osterman and I just finished up my Freshman year here at ICC. I’m getting my associate’s degree in Secure Software Development and my Certification in Computer Programming and Database Development.
My interests include gaming, programming, movies & TV.
Feel free to reach out to me at ko268@icc.lab.edu.
I look forward to getting to know you all</p>
